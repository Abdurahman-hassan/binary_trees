# binary_trees
This repository, binary_trees, is a collaborative educational project created by students of Holberton School and ALX AFRICA. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing binary trees, a fundamental concept in computer science.
Binary trees are a type of hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children. There are several types of binary trees, each with its unique characteristics:
1. Full Binary Tree: A full binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children
2. Perfect Binary Tree: A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level 1235.
